You're working on software.
You use a git repo for your local development, but the main project is 
actually managed in bzr.
This is a little script to help create patches from git and apply them to bzr.
To use it:
 (1) install git-bzr in /usr/local/bin 
 (2) edit ~/git-bzr.rc to define three variables:
    GIT_TREE is the path to the git repo
    BZR_TREE is the path to the bzr repo
    WORK_DIR is a working directory where git-bzr will manage patches and logs
